## Abstract

Analysis of stochastic processes can be used to engender critical thinking. Quantum dots have a reversible, stochastic transition between luminescent and nonluminescent states. The luminescence intermittency is known as blinking and is not evident from ensemble measurements. In order to stimulate critical thinking, students design, perform, and analyze a semiconductor quantum dot blinking laboratory experiment. The design of the experiment and stochastic nature of the data collected require students to make judgements throughout the course of the single-particle measurement and analysis. Some of the decisions do not have uniquely correct answers, challenging the students to engage in critical thinking. We propose that students’ self-examined decision making develops a constructivist view of science. The experiment is visually striking, is interdisciplinary, and develops higher order thinking.

Semiconductor quantum dot blinking refers to the intermittent switching between luminescent and non-luminescent states in semiconductor quantum dots. Quantum dots are small semiconductor particles that exhibit unique optical properties, such as fluorescence, due to their size and composition. In some cases, the fluorescence of a single quantum dot can turn on and off rapidly, a phenomenon known as blinking. This blinking can occur on a time scale of microseconds to minutes, and is not evident in ensemble measurements. It is a stochastic process, meaning that the probability of a quantum dot switching between states can be described by a probability distribution. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of quantum dot blinking is important for applications such as bioimaging, single-molecule sensing, and optoelectronics.

Quantum dot (QD) blinking is the phenomenon in which semiconductor quantum dots switch between an “on” state (luminescent) and an “off” state (non-luminescent) and exhibit a power-law distribution of on and off times with exponents from 1.0 to 2.0. The Efros-Rosen model based on semiconductor physics was proposed in 1997 to explain QD blinking, but various modifications and other statistical models have been suggested since then. Here, an energy-band model for QDs that captures the full range of blinking behavior reported in the literature is described, providing new insight into features such as the gray state, the power-law distribution of on and off times, and the power-law exponents.

The article explains a model for the dynamics of electron-hole pairs in quantum dots, which is based on the physics of quantum dots and descriptions of recombination and trapping processes. The model is implemented using kinetic Monte Carlo methods and the state of the quantum dot is represented by (ij), where i is the total number of electrons and holes, and j is the number of trapped charge carriers. The model includes several possible transitions between states, each with corresponding rates, and the time that the QD will remain in a certain state is determined by these rates. The population of states with trapped carriers results in off states, where the QD is less likely to emit photons, while the population of states without trapped carriers results in on states, where the QD is more likely to emit photons. The intensity-time curves are obtained by counting the number of photons emitted in each bin time.

Scientists at JILA, a joint venture of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado at Boulder, have discovered a way to solve the blinking problem of quantum dots, which reduces their usefulness in biomedical research, cryptography and other fields. They found that by bathing the dots in a watery solution of an antioxidant chemical used as a food additive, they were able to increase the photon emission rate four- to fivefold and reduce the average time delay between excitation of a quantum dot and resulting photon emission from 21 nanoseconds to 4 nanoseconds. Additionally, the probability of blinking was reduced up to 100 fold. The blinking problem occurs when an electron fails to return to its "hole" and instead is ejected to imperfections on the dot's surface, causing the dot to blink off. The chemical added at JILA attaches to these imperfections, blocking the electron from being trapped and preventing the dot from blinking off.
Yes, the blinking of quantum dots can reduce their usefulness in certain applications, such as in fluorescent tagging and single-photon generation, due to the intermittent nature of their light emission. However, blinking can also be used as a measurement probe for slow rates of electron flow in nanoscale materials. The JILA study that I mentioned in my previous response found a way to reduce blinking in quantum dots and improve their performance in certain applications.

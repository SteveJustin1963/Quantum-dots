## Abstract

Analysis of stochastic processes can be used to engender critical thinking. Quantum dots have a reversible, stochastic transition between luminescent and nonluminescent states. The luminescence intermittency is known as blinking and is not evident from ensemble measurements. In order to stimulate critical thinking, students design, perform, and analyze a semiconductor quantum dot blinking laboratory experiment. The design of the experiment and stochastic nature of the data collected require students to make judgements throughout the course of the single-particle measurement and analysis. Some of the decisions do not have uniquely correct answers, challenging the students to engage in critical thinking. We propose that studentsâ€™ self-examined decision making develops a constructivist view of science. The experiment is visually striking, is interdisciplinary, and develops higher order thinking.

Semiconductor quantum dot blinking refers to the intermittent switching between luminescent and non-luminescent states in semiconductor quantum dots. Quantum dots are small semiconductor particles that exhibit unique optical properties, such as fluorescence, due to their size and composition. In some cases, the fluorescence of a single quantum dot can turn on and off rapidly, a phenomenon known as blinking. This blinking can occur on a time scale of microseconds to minutes, and is not evident in ensemble measurements. It is a stochastic process, meaning that the probability of a quantum dot switching between states can be described by a probability distribution. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of quantum dot blinking is important for applications such as bioimaging, single-molecule sensing, and optoelectronics.
